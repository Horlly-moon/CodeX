## Overview
This is my first frontend mentor project as a beginner where i was challenged to build a QR code component, I am going to be providing the guide and solution i used in building the project

### Screenshot

There is a screenshot of the final project in the "Project" directory





### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Margin
- Padding




### What I learned

I learnt how to use the "Div" tag with the use of classes and i was also able to make use of Margin and Padding when styling my project


These are some of the code snippets that i used in building the project

```html
<div class="card-container"></div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  padding-top: 15px;
  padding-left: 10px;
  padding-right: 10px;
  margin: auto;
}
```


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I would love to know how to use the "Margin" and "Padding" to build more responsive projects in the Future.
I would also love to learn how to make use of the Flexbox and CSS Grid and Media Queries also for future projects.


### Useful resources

- [Google fonts](https://www.googlefonts.com) - This helped me in picking out the suitable font for the project. I really liked this font and will use it going forward.
